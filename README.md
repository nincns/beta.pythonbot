pi-top based rover from pi-top robotic kit with modified chaintrack

I built this robot from a pi-top robot kit and added a chain drive. The aim is for the robot to be able to drive on its own without danger and explore its surroundings. Photos should be taken again and again, which can be analyzed later.
